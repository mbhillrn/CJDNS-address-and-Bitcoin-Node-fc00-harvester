## What Your Donation Supports

- **Continued development** - New features, bug fixes, improvements
- **Database updates** - I'll keep scanning and updating the included `state.db` with new addresses
- **Better documentation** - More guides, examples, troubleshooting tips
- **Testing** - Running multiple CJDNS nodes to test features like remote harvesting
- **Coffee** - Let's be honest, this is mostly powered by caffeine

This project is **completely free and open source** under the MIT license. You don't have to donate to use it.

But if you:

- Want to see more features added

...then a donation would be awesome!

## What I'm Working On Next

Current todo list (donations help motivate me to tackle these faster):

- [ ] Web interface for browsing the address database
- [ ] Automatic peer rotation / connection manager
- [ ] Integration with Bitcoin Core DNS seeds
- [ ] More robust error handling for edge cases
- [ ] Performance optimizations for large databases
- [ ] Maybe a Windows version? (if enough people want it)
